## Biome Miner

This was supposed to be a simple plugin that allowed players to mine biomes however Spigot & Mojang 
have code thats so screwed up I have to abandon this plugin. Theres numerous glitches and issues
when calling `setBiome` and `getBiome` that mkes this plugin entriely unusable.

I was hoping to at least brush some of the glitches off as features to get it shipped out but
it's far too many glitches and issues.

This marks the 5th thing Ive tried to make but had to abandon because Minecraft's code is
some of the worst I've seen and the glitches and obscurity that result from that make plugin
after plugin fail.

If anyone can get this working be my guest.

I typically make simple and quick plugins everyone would love so it's unbelivable to me to
encounter so many dead ends trying to make simple plugins.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
