## Biome Miner

This was supposed to be a simple plugin that allowed players to mine biomes however apparently with the release of 1.15, they decided to really complicate biome changes. It's no longer per-block but aproximated per 4x4 area. The changes make this plugin glitchy and I abandoned it for a while but decided to finally add it anyways.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
